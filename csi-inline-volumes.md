# In-line CSI volumes in Pods

Author: @jsafrane

## Goal
* Define API and high level design for in-line CSI volumes in Pod

## Motivation
Currently, CSI can be used only though PersistentVolume object. All other persistent volume sources support in-line volumes in Pods, CSI should be no exception. There are two main drivers:
* We need the API and CSI volume plugin ready to move away from in-tree volume plugins to CSI, as designed in a separate proposal https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/2199/
* CSI drivers can be used to provide Secrets-like volumes to pods, e.g. reading secrets from a remote vault. We don't want to force users to create PVs for each secret, we should allow to use them in-line in pods as regular Secrets or Secrets-like flex volumes.

## API
`VolumeSource` needs to be extended with CSI volume source:
```go
type VolumeSource struct {

	// CSI (Container Storage Interface) represents storage that handled by an external CSI driver (Beta feature).
	// +optional
	CSI *CSIVolumeSource
}


// Represents storage that is managed by an external CSI volume driver (Beta feature)
type CSIPersistentVolumeSource struct {
	// Driver is the name of the driver to use for this volume.
	// Required.
	Driver string

	// VolumeHandle is the unique volume name returned by the CSI volume
	// pluginâ€™s CreateVolume to refer to the volume on all subsequent calls.
	// Required.
	VolumeHandle string

	// Optional: The value to pass to ControllerPublishVolumeRequest.
	// Defaults to false (read/write).
	// +optional
	ReadOnly bool

	// Filesystem type to mount.
	// Must be a filesystem type supported by the host operating system.
	// Ex. "ext4", "xfs", "ntfs". Implicitly inferred to be "ext4" if unspecified.
	// +optional
	FSType string

	// Attributes of the volume to publish.
	// +optional
	VolumeAttributes map[string]string

	// ControllerPublishSecretRef is a reference to the secret object containing
	// sensitive information to pass to the CSI driver to complete the CSI
	// ControllerPublishVolume and ControllerUnpublishVolume calls.
	// This field is optional, and  may be empty if no secret is required. If the
	// secret object contains more than one secret, all secrets are passed.
	// +optional
	ControllerPublishSecretRef *SecretReference

	// NodeStageSecretRef is a reference to the secret object containing sensitive
	// information to pass to the CSI driver to complete the CSI NodeStageVolume
	// and NodeStageVolume and NodeUnstageVolume calls.
	// This field is optional, and  may be empty if no secret is required. If the
	// secret object contains more than one secret, all secrets are passed.
	// +optional
	NodeStageSecretRef *SecretReference

	// NodePublishSecretRef is a reference to the secret object containing
	// sensitive information to pass to the CSI driver to complete the CSI
	// NodePublishVolume and NodeUnpublishVolume calls.
	// This field is optional, and  may be empty if no secret is required. If the
	// secret object contains more than one secret, all secrets are passed.
	// +optional
	NodePublishSecretRef *SecretReference
}
